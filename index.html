          <b>Welcome to my world of data visualization!</b>	This is the beginning of my journey to share both my work and my thoughts. I feel truly grateful that you’ve taken the time to visit my site and it feels like we were meant to meet here.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently a graduate student at Ontario Tech University, a public research institution in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada. Returning to campus after more than 15 years has been both exciting and challenging. The course materials themselves are not too difficult to follow, but keeping up with the technology has been a real adventure. Beyond the basics of Microsoft Office and Gmail, nearly all the tools introduced in my courses are new to me. Interestingly, some of these tools have even appeared in my teenagers’ homework assignments – something I only came to realize not long ago.
		</p> <p> 
		  Until recently, I had very little exposure to generative AIs, simply because it wasn’t needed in my job. Having spent the past decade in China, I now feel fortunate to have this opportunity to embrace new technologies, refresh my perspective, and equip myself with skills that are increasingly essential. Even the long commute to campus feels worthwhile when I think about how much I’m learning and growing.
		</p> <p> 
		  Ontario Tech is located just over an hour’s drive from downtown Toronto, but without a car, my commute stretches to about two and a half hours each way. Despite the distance, I remain motivated by the chance to learn, grow, and share my journey with others.
		 </p> <p>
		  My professional background lies in the field of intellectual property, where I worked for many years. By nature, I am quiet and introverted, and I usually keep to myself unless there’s a genuine reason to reach out. I look forward to sharing further insights and experiences here, and I welcome you to accompany me on this path of discovery.

        <h2>About My Work</h2>
        <p>
		  This collection showcases my work completed for the course MBAI 5400G - Visualization and Storytelling, developed under the insightful supervision of Dr. Gabby Resch. These pieces represent a significant personal commitment; and they may contain flaws and simplicity that reflect my ongoing growth in the field, but I dedicated extensive hours and my best effort to the design and execution of each assignment.</p><p>
		  The projects represent moments of growth and resilience, forcing me to tackle challenging tasks, such as shifting from a broad data question to a human-centered narrative (Assignment 1) and pushing me to master new tools like Python for interactive visualization (Assignment 2). The final individual piece (Assignment 3) was a powerful exercise in creating a persuasive visual argument about the social crisis of food affordability.</p><p>
		  The group project (Assignment 4) provided the opportunity to synthesize and combine human-centered narrative, robust data analysis, and advanced visualization techniques into one comprehensive final project.</p><p>
		  The entire experience of collating these assignments and presenting them here has been highly enjoyable, and I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Professor Dr. Gabby Resch for the insightful guidance, to the Teaching Assistant, Chole, for the generous support, and to my kind, helpful classmates and knowledgeable team members for the shared knowledge and collaborative spirit.
