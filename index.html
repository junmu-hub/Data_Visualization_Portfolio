          <b>Welcome to my world of data visualization!</b> 
		  This is the beginning of my journey to share both my work and my thoughts. I feel truly grateful that you’ve taken the time to visit my site and it feels like we were meant to meet here.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently a graduate student at Ontario Tech University, a public research institution in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada. Returning to campus after more than 15 years has been both exciting and challenging. The course materials themselves are not too difficult to follow, but keeping up with the technology has been a real adventure. Beyond the basics of Microsoft Office and Gmail, nearly all the tools introduced in my courses are new to me. Interestingly, some of these tools have even appeared in my teenagers’ homework assignments – something I only came to realize not long ago.
		  
		  Until recently, I had very little exposure to generative AIs, simply because it wasn’t needed in my job. Having spent the past decade in China, I now feel fortunate to have this opportunity to embrace new technologies, refresh my perspective, and equip myself with skills that are increasingly essential. Even the long commute to campus feels worthwhile when I think about how much I’m learning and growing.
		  
		  Ontario Tech is located just over an hour’s drive from downtown Toronto, but without a car, my commute stretches to about two and a half hours each way. Despite the distance, I remain motivated by the chance to learn, grow, and share my journey with others.
		  
		  My professional background lies in the field of intellectual property, where I worked for many years. By nature, I am quiet and introverted, and I usually keep to myself unless there’s a genuine reason to reach out. I look forward to sharing further insights and experiences here, and I welcome you to accompany me on this path of discovery.

        <h2>What I Hope to Learn / Do</h2>
        <p>
          <!-- Replace with your own learning goals -->
          Through my coursework and projects, I am learning how to design
          visualizations that are accurate, honest, and easy to understand,
          so that decision-makers can quickly see what the data is saying.
